# 01 - Introduction to SSH Key Pairs

### Overview of SSH Key Pairs
SSH (Secure Shell) key pairs consist of two cryptographic keys: a **private key** and a **public key**. These keys are used to authenticate and secure communication between a client and a server.

### Practical Approach
In this section, we'll cover the step-by-step process of generating an SSH key pair and setting up secure communication with a remote server. This includes:
1. **Generating SSH Key Pairs**
2. **Copying the Public Key to the Server**
3. **Verifying SSH Key Authentication**

By following these steps, you can ensure a secure, password-less connection to your remote server, enhancing the overall security of your system.
